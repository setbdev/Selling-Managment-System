# Selling-Managment-System
This simple application is for a hamburger store, to manage their sellings
It's not a business application that used for a real company.

Here, I just demonstrated Object Oriented Programming techniques such as : Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism. 
Wrote clean, and understandable code (not spagetti!).
